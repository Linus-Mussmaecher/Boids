# Boids
A small C++ project containing a 2D-Boid simulation.

## Inspiration

Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw).

## Customization

Before executing: Change constants in boids.h to get different speeds and sizes (etc.).
Change the argument of the run_basic function in main.cpp to spawn a different number of boids.

When compiling with the DEBUG-Flag, a single chosen boid will have its vision range displayed.

When executing: Left click + drag to add rectangular obstacles, right click to remove them again.
